The dying light of morning stuck,  
Clung by chilly, smoky air,  
And the pigeon and finch soundbite spells,  
That died to the highway at 6am.

The daylight's breath of car-soaked fumes,  
Was a single oxide shy of safe,  
As each machine layed traffic-queued,  
To kill the world and dig its grave anew,

The clearest sight in the streetside view.
