I couldn't stop for Azreal to weather burning wings,  
And the Muslim in the girl that raised me thinks that that's a sin,  
But the both of us know all too well that we're at risk to make the pact,  
And likelier than I to play that game and to enact.

She has her lilies and her roses sat in vases all assorted,  
Like the symbolism for a life that she couldn't have aborted,  
So sit me down and play a tune now that we can't share a muse,  
Amuse me as we pass the time and dig in sand to draw a line tonight.

Please wisen me I've been curious,  
How does a gemstone fail disperse,  
The light that's shone now overdue,  
It stopped and chose to shine right through.
