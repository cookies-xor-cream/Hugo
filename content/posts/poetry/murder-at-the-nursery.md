I said hi to you in passing,  
On a day in the dead of summer,  
Record it by the sweat I wore  
Remembered by the heatwave's strokes.

You said hi back, a sleight of tongue?  
Is this a lapse in judgement spied?  
I said hi, and then hello again,  
You said it back and I knew then.

That my friend was dead.

Hello, orphan,  
Hello again.
