I think that I  
Can't bear to watch  
The fabric as it  
Comes to tear.

We're always stuck  
Just one heart short,  
In need of double bit  
Support.

The flashing lights  
And sudden sounds  
Don't rattle me,  
My head is sound.

But it's the drinking  
That lets me brave,  
Through lacked circumstance  
That I wholely crave.

Be it crow, or raven,  
Or magpie vulture,  
I ducked it and I  
Flew right under.

But wagtails are  
A backup plan,  
For when their shit  
Starts to hit the fan.

They perch upon  
The lowly wall,  
And pounce upon  
Without their claws.

But I dodged the sutures,  
I dodged the stitches,  
I ducked the magpies,  
These birds are bitches.
