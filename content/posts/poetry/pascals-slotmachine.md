"If you think about it, think enough,
Take a few pills and it's a problem,
But take too many and it fixes the PTS"

'So you missed the funeral thinking logistics?'

"You expect me to stop and to feel
Every single thing that happens?"

'I expect you to tell me that you
Were there, when it matters'.

"And I expected you to be there"

'So why aren't you there now, disaster'

"I see people the length of the day,
I'd rather walk away from this spectre"

"She has a name, fucking use it,"

'You used it a lot, didn't you?'

"What's that supposed to mean?"

'I'm not deaf is what it should
mean to you'.

"It's not like you didn't know,"

'Didn't enjoy to hear it though,'

"Make me a wager then?"

'Okay Pascal'.

"We'll flip a coin: heads and it's your street"

"Tails and you leave the flowers in this
Sunlight's stream"
