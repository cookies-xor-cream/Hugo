I know I never wrote back,  
But you know what that implies.  
You need to stop wrwiting,  
To lose the tether; cut the tie.

I'm sorry for the lack of distance,  
And I'm sorry if the distance drags,  
I'm sorry for the lacked resistance,  
And I'm sorry for what I let pass.

I'll find you, I have done so twice,  
We'll roll the dice and pick the place,  
I'd call it luck but know too well,  
The flow of oil's the lucky taste.

I know you chased, and I was first,  
But her ghastly glare will take away,  
A thousand things we can deny,  
But only one thing we must say.

One thing waiting, subtly haunting,  
As every moment comes to die,  
From past to present, and then to future,  
It wraps around for another time.

The first one's brief, but took so long,  
I couldn't read the fucking lines,  
Between the ones that had *her* name,  
And the one you forgot to sign.

"I know the nightmares never stop",  
Not for you and justly so,  
"But exhaustion is my slumber spell",  
And that's something that I hate to know.
