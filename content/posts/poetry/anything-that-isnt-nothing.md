You think that thinking's a valid way,  
To logic out the shit you'd say.

But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,  
The coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,  
The accumulation keeps you up at night.

You didn't even have the drink,  
You only breathed the citric dust,  
And that's a promise you won't keep.

But you know that you should wear a mask,  
Though you can't be fussed or bothered so.

So you gargle-blood the night away,  
And know the doctor'll make you stay,  
If you tell them that it went this way.

And I don't have the patience but,  
God I have the time.

Feels like the indirect-est way  
To make honesty a crime.
