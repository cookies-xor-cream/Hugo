When I cleaned my drawer's shelves,
I'd found her old notebook,
I then realised a half-page in,
How her writing must've looked.

I recognised the words she used,
And the water-damage too,
But she was writing riverside,
By the angel dust and fumes.

You can't trace out any lines,
When the orchid was in bloom,
Of the mixture of an eight-ball ket,
And a quarter-filled balloon.
