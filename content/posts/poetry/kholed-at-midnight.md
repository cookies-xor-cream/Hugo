Just tell me how you spiked this cup,  
Coz that's an offer that I'd take up,  
But don't lie to me, I know that look,  
Let's just drink it and we'll find a book.

"There's nothing there, there never was  
don't overplay it, don't make a fuss",  
If I'm asleep by Wednesday noon,  
the both of us will wake entombed.

"We've always got to cut a deal,  
always find a way to steal,  
the joy out of each and every day,  
you know what I want to hear you say"

Fuck, yes, I guess I'll say okay,  
If it's what you want: then please pray tell,  
I'll drink it, and we'll roll through mud,  
I'll drink it, and we'll sleep through floods.

"The water's cold and number than  
Your icy heart and frosty tact"  
You didn't have to name the kid,  
Least not post-mortem like you did.

"You can just say it directly,  
One 'fuck you' that's aptly put,  
To leave me in the river flow,  
Abandoned in the salt and soot".

I did it so, but you got there first,  
It hurt to breath the saline dirt,  
But holed or whole and wholely just,  
We promptly met this earthly crust.
