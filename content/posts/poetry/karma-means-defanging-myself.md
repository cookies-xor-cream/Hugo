Keep me breathing,  
I'll live with heaving,  
I don't hate you,  
I'm only grieving.

Thanks for all  
The breath I drew,  
And with each one  
I had thought of you.

And thought that I  
Should forget about  
The nowheres and  
The roundabout.

You knew, coz I told  
You every week.  
But you say you didn't,  
Now I can't speak.

But that's old news,  
I know it is.  
I left you clues.  
I knew I did.

Just pull my teeth,  
And lay them bare,  
With locust swarms  
It might be fair.
