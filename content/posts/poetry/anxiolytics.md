    Anxiolytics:
    Sanity Is A Place Between Stuttering And Forgetting
date: 2023-03-03

They robbed my heartrate and my words
Every sentence I thought to speak
Fell in and through the veil of speech
That drove my thoughts and varied ticks

"When'd it start?"
*"Think I was six"*

"And did the anxiolytics help?"
*"They squashed my thoughts
And my nervous ticks"*
"So why claim to me that they did not?"

*"It helps me in the likeness that
You can come to help someone
At knifepoint
In the parking lot."*
