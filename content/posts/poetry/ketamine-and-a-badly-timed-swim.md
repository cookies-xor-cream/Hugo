I'm sat by the shore,  
On the side that you fell.

You wished with a noose,  
So I saw to it well.

And you slipped out your body,  
I saw as you slipped.

But you dared to deny me,  
As I reached for a sip.

I can hear it all dripping,  
As it 'knocks' I suppose.

It came for the throne,  
With the old king deposed.

And if you might live,  
I can see to that too.

Aim not for your head,  
But aim to shoot through.

And if you might come rise,  
With a flood of the drowned.

Then take me right now,  
I am ripe for the crown.

Please come with my dreams,  
We'll be lost in our fate.

Well throw out the key,  
As we're locking the gate.

As I'm writing the rest,  
I find my pen skips.

To the waterlogged step,  
Of this man as he trips.

In a double entendre,  
And in double the sense.

Come here forthwith,  
We can sit as we pense.

I stranded myself,  
But you chose to be here.

You stranded yourself,  
And you chose me my dear.
