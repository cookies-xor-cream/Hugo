She's the corpus of a spirit,  
She's a smear of the past,  
She's a hollow shell of  
What she inherits at last.

She's the lack of a battle,  
She's the chorus reversed,  
She's the carapace of  
The finish to a quieter verse.

She's my pinch on her chin,  
She's a record stood still,  
I think that that's fine  
But I wish she would spin.

She's a 10 minute walk,  
She's a flower in wilt,  
She's definitive proof  
I need something to sip.

She's her eyes on my face,  
She's a hiccup in time,  
She's the anachronism  
That we're flipping the dime.
