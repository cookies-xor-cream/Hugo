Your steely guards and glassy stares,  
Are from bloodshot eyes who do not care.

Can we turn back time to plant a seed,  
And trap an oracle inside that tree?

It'll put the hindsight in the foresight,  
Of my -7 strong smeared blind spot eyesight.

But I'll steal the eyes from in the bark,  
And cast the truth out through this farce.

I went too far, was brash not bold,  
Made lapdogs act as they were told.

Truth is subjective, and I've got a map,  
Opinion's objectivity wearing a hat.

The cartographer has died in me,  
And I'm the very last to clearly see.

I bawled my eyes but lost the root,  
And without the plant there is no fruit.

Delphi can't see roulette wheels roll,  
But she knows when she will strike her gold.

A premonition now has auditioned,  
And all on black then needs omission.

You gave up Pascal, declined his wager,  
For something that is tenfolds the stranger.

For someone now tenfolds the stranger,  
For twice the risk, and twice the danger.

I'm not a stranger,  
I'm not a stranger,  
I'm just a stranger,  
I'm just a stranger.
