I threw up all my words last night,
Gonna take a little break,
guess that I won't write.

Think I've exhumed the static confluence,
Breathed out the poison with its essence.

If I couldn't pry my mouth to talk,
Then I wouldn't even have to try,
But I have to find a way to walk
From my door to bed tonight.

Slept harder and better,
Than all fucking week.
Time and its passage
Got caught in my sleep.

I Didn't dream and didn't nightmare,
It was just a blackened splash of sable screen.

Four long, short, hours of happy.
