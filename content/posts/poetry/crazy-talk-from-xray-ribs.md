You came back from the doctor's,  
and the discussions of your bruise,  
But he didn't give you any pills,  
Why'd you mention that you used?

It'd been a half year since  
shedding x-ray ribs, since the  
stitches had been removed.

I mentioned home in passing,  
And then you were suggesting  
That I moved?
