I'll mark my path  
And then I'll hound,  
I'll snake the words  
When they are found.

Think of words I waste  
But seldom breathe, then  
Bleed the whiskey's taste  
Till it secedes.

There's a thousand things  
I shouldn't say,  
And even more  
I shouldn't think.

But I'm treading ground  
And marking seas,  
On broken boats  
That slowly sink.

And if you find  
My dying light:  
Just bid farewell  
Please say goodnight.

We'll slowly sink,  
We're at the edge,  
So come and teeter  
Out from this ledge.

We'll slowly sink  
Down waterfalls,  
As this planeship of a boat,  
Begins to throttle and to stall.
