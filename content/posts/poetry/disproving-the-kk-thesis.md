I need the fucking verbosity  
To be thinking through the gravity  
Of how cut up we got:  
Bar the scars and scratches.

I still remember forgetting,  
The scenery sliding into a wreckage,  
I don't know what car you drove,  
But that shit must've been expensive.

I still forget recalling  
All of the shit you took to drive,  
And finding it all out after,  
But fuck it, you still drove okay.

And the last thing I remembered,  
Was when I got reared by your car,  
And now I'm still a little afraid  
To help any of my friends when they park.

We were lucky to be alive throughout,  
But the scales can't tip that way forever,  
I suppose that it aggregates,  
And your luck was only average.

Chance made us bite guesswork's bullet,  
But I remember us mapping it out,  
Like a single big decision graph  
Of an Imperfect Information Game.

Everything else was subpar,  
We knew we were a funeral,  
Or maybe a wedding, apart,  
From permanence or transience.

And the beta blockers  
Did they ever help?  
Coz I still remember  
How your hands would start to shake.

I still remember your mum  
When she loved me,  
And when she didn't,  
But I don't remember her name,

Just fucking called her 'aunty'  
(I'm sorry)
