The first is misery, that's found fermented,  
It tinges sweet but with acetic hues,  
You somehow miss the caustic burn,  
Even when remembering equates to self-abuse.

The second is a remembrance prayer,  
You know only blurs of truths raced past,  
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,  
You lost the metal, but kept the cast.

The third one is a vacant feeling,  
Where you try it, but with quicksand rules,  
Where aiming makes you miss the mark,  
And struggling means you lose the heart.

And the final one: its purest form,  
An uncut dose of pastimes dead,  
That comes comedown-less,  
And doesn't dare to spark the dread.

I think I find the disparity funny,  
Like a testament to my priorities,  
The following is an ordered list,  
From one to four, the life I've lived.

From one to four, the past I missed:  
The first one's dead,  
The second moved,  
I don't care for this one,  
And the last one's a cartoon.
