The sky was once so cold at night,  
To nip the desert heat that bites,  
But I bide my time and bid farewell,  
And freeze inside the searing glare.

Of all the notions I can't seem sell,  
I most of all miss the ice clung air,  
The sealess stare of seam-filled rocks,  
That lack the water to fill the clocks.

But now I live by seaside straits,  
By salty water that solely hates,  
The things I need and tends to take,  
The things I need,to try to break me.

From ocean view to desert streets,  
That I've walked along but couldn't find  
Where heaven meets this heat.
