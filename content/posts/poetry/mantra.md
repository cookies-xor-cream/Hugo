The light and sound,  
Both pale besides,  
The flashbang rooms  
And neon signs.

I waited out,  
I stalled for you,  
Then I idled by,  
As I missed you.

It was 2 months then,  
I didn't know what the  
Next month brought,  
But I do now.

At least I'm alive,  
I am alive,  
I was alive,  
I am alive.
