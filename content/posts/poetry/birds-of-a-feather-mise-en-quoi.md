The blood, and crying,  
And a thousand things you can't recall,  
Are no excuse for you to stall,  
Give me the keys to the cabinet,  
I'll lock up your alcohol.

I find your gaze in eyeless stares,  
That found flight as they had carried you,  
To stories above my newfound glare.  
"You know it that I couldn't care."

The difference in the downwards pull,  
From here and from the earth below,  
Is strong enough to extract your bones,  
However dense, however however hollow.

I'm nightmareless, I'm flashback sans,  
I don't want to dig up the visions,  
Of your broken and your sanguine hands,  
I just want you to come and  
To gamble and to take a chance.

A chance for you,  
A chance for me,  
Let me talk you  
Off the window sill.

And then we're through.  
"You know that I can't care"  
I don't know what more to do with you,  
You'd make the jump on a fucking dare.

A bottle says you could,  
And if they could speak the  
Rest would that,  
That sorely you must do.

I'm not looking for a fight,  
I'm not looking to speak in metre,  
I'm not looking to be forcing you  
To rhyme.

Give me keys, it's come the time,  
I'll separate you from yourself,  
And when you're finally not spinning out,  
They'll be waiting on the lowest shelf.

And you'll be waiting on the ground,  
Not sound of mind but in every other way,  
We'll find you safe and sound.
