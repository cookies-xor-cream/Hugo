Every breath I took today,  
Is stunted slightly lighter,  
Than every death I've  
Long since lived past.

She dismantled tombs  
That we had laid,  
Then a second one  
Found the coffins.

And she undid the nails.

I hammered them with teeth,  
But she found the time to softly speak,  
To tell me that I must see breath,  
To tell me I need sorely breathe.

She didn't have the right,  
To pull my fangs,  
But saw my death,  
And it made her tense.

For every death that she repressed.

She played the teacher,  
She pulled my claws,  
And taught me that each  
and everyone.

Is made of their flaws.
