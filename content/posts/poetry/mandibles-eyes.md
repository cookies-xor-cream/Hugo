Frosted glass and broken windows,  
The barking on the midnight walk,  
Has nothing left to show me now,  
And I've nowhere left to go.

Was on Ullapool and Bombard,  
Things were said but not by me,  
And I'm making my life hard now,  
And you think that I don't see?

He begged me: "stay home",  
But I'm deaf on the right,  
I gotta get off the phone,  
Coz I'm catching a ride.

I'll be finishing it,  
And the sky will be blue,  
As bit by small bit,  
I'll be passing by you.

I'm on the path to my house,  
There like an ant on a hill,  
And I'm molting the cause,  
Coz I'm towered by it.

And the mandible claws,  
Aren't making the bug,  
Edibles back-slung,  
In their stomachs dissolve.

I abstained from partaking,  
Don't know where I've been,  
But there's a pheromone trail,  
And it leads to the sin.

I never resolved it.
