She read notes she shouldn't read,  
From girls she shouldn't,  
Try so fucking hard to breath.

'Katherine, please, the crap you read,  
It's all filling up your empty head,  
Don't play around with the hollow box  
And the fragments of that eldritch dread.'

"We'll take off soon, we'll head to mine,  
Since I'm emergency contact one,  
I've got the shots, I've got your meds,  
Got the hypnotics and the seds."

'Do you really think you're making sense?  
She'll hate you now, and forevermore,  
You'd have to be so fucking dense  
To be the one to take her home.'

"I'm older, I'm with her, and you're besides her,  
I'll keep her chained unto my sight,  
I just want to have layed besides her,  
Want to have braved these vacant nights"

'These vacant nights?! Do you see her state?  
The cold is clawing, she's fever-pitched,  
If you pick her up off from this bed,  
I wouldn't watch it while she gets restitched.'

"I know you will, don't tell these lies,  
I saw the looks, I've watched your eyes,  
If I were you: I'd promptly quit,  
I'd go back home, and idly sit."

I sat at home I'd like to think,  
I don't remember a fucking thing.

But I know I left the wanderlust,  
I'm not someone who I wanted lost.

I hope that you could find your place,  
In that lonely frantic frenzied phase.

I'd never been so wrong before,  
But she was moreso, as I foretold.
