It's been a half a dozen hours since,  
Where's the blood: I'm curious,  
Has it been rained on and been rinsed,  
From seven to one past twelve.

My sheets are soaked.  
My shirt is soaked.  
The tissues ran out,  
Now they're all soaked.

My bloody nose,  
Knows no remorse,  
It just keeps pumping,  
To juxtapose  
This image of my tearless eyes  
With the painted face, but you might find,  
It didn't time the thing quite right.

Now it'll watch as my eyes both dry,  
At least it's not like watching paint  
Run and turn alive.
