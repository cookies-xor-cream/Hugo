I pick up every sound I hear,
It distorts and never stays the same,
But it always preserves the fear,
I wish I could tip it over,
I wish I could unhear.

"There was a thud and it sticks,
It was loud but so nondescript,
And it buried me in all the sounds
Of the shit I got prescript.

And I can't shake off the shudder,
Those muffled muted screams,
Like we're stuck inside a house,
That can't hold a single mouse.

And one of the first things I remember,
Is the sound of your mouth crackling,
On danish butter cookie embers,
Takes the ash and returns to sender.

The next thing breaks the timeline,
Like I'm stuck inside a one-way street,
Staring at the wrong-way signs,
But I've skipped each and every beat.

I'd let you bloodlet the rest of it 
If you choose to let me choose from it,
To save only the greatest bits,
I only want a taste of it.

I'd take the red splatter,
I'd take the fabric rip,
As bloody clothing tatters,
But I don't think it matters.

We're a dreg of a girl, a vestige broken,
The lights were too bright,
And if it's any token:
I toggled the ceiling fans.

A dozen or two attempts,
That's all it took to find the blades
That undercut the yellow tent,
Of light that lost us shelter.

They took out the friendly fans,
And overruled the very last,
Of our photosensitive plans --
Those afterthoughts that wouldn't last."

Somewhere between a fire,
And the caustic Tunisian ash,
The forest blaze ignites
And it has come to dance.

Well, I'm gonna watch the show,
From my bedroom windows lattice,
As the decaying corpses glow,
In catalyst till they don't exist.

'Arya, I could tell you what happened.
I didn't see it but I've heard,
Not the sounds but
The whispers from the herd.'

"I don't want to know,
And I don't want to make that trade,
I should pack my shit and go.
I never fucking asked to know"

'It's funny that you're the one,
Who two is too much company for,
And the only first hand recount,
Begrieving what you forgot you swore.'

"Goodbye Amber, I'm goin now,
Don't lose me another decade,
But please never fucking call,
I can't take the heartache,

Of hearing of you with her again"

'Thought it didn't matter who was with who'
"I trusted it'd be ANYONE but you"

It started with the concrete fires,
And it can end with Tunisian ash.

آتش و ال کالی
