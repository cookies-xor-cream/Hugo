It's fucking weird that I can't breath,  
What's that saying that she used?  
Every time that we fall asleep,  
We wake up more confused?

Between the coughing fits  
And the wearing down of us,  
We have a while to go  
And here I am waiting on the bus.

Like all that I recall  
Is all I have forgot,  
Like this blackhole of a life  
Is all I've begot.

The days all rot and blend,  
And all that you have left,  
Is to swear to me that you,  
Are still working on the mend.

Icarus,  
You fly on waxy wings,  
We know it all to well,  
And I bet you do as well.
