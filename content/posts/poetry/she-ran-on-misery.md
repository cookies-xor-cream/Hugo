When your words fall short,  
You gotta learn to resort to bolt action,  
Coz we're using ferrous rounds but,  
Spark a diamagnetic dis-attraction.

"Would you have spent the night with me,  
If I was short an amine group?  
You don't have to lie to me.  
You know that I can take the truth".

I lied but wore a good-faith smile,  
And told her what she needs to hear,  
*"If you got rid of the chemistry,  
You know you wouldn't find me here".*
