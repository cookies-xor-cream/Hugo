title: Stuck In The Glass Lake Of A Local Extrema

Stick me in this lake of ash,
While the fire lays expunged,
It's stuck in perpetuity,
Blowing out a cast of glass

Between the tachycardic trills
Of krill-filled breaths through filter-feed,
You met your death by way
Of ambergriss.

And I would cast you out a net,
If you'd the arms to tie a noose,
And I'd make sure
That I wouldn't tie it loose.

That shit was a package deal,
But you've got the exit scam
And eyes like steel,
That you can not seem anneal.

But we'll set p high,
And bring it low,
We'll watch the lattice
As it forms.

We'll watch it run,
With t increased,
As we 'learn'
And we 'reform'.
