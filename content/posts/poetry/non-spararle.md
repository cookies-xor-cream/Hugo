"I don't know why all this wait,  
I feel like we've stopped crossing fates"

And that final line was true:  
It spoke of the destiny That we'd accrued.

"And now was overdue"  
I could never live with you  
"And I could never live without"  
I hope the afterlife can sort this out

"Or else I might take a chance,  
And end this shit by force tonight"

That anachronistic thought  
Had echoed in my head,  
As I had once recalled  
That we're worst friends

"Of one long dead".

"A pistol speaks no love",  
Since your fusillade can't hit a dove,  
"You'll need bring passion"  
With no heart

"To bring yourself  
To bring a knife".

To bring a killing.  
To a wedding.

With hell betwixt  
Your sorry smile  
And laden wrist  
Conscript.

We'll overdose on non-prescripts.
