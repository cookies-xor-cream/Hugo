Butterflies with tattered wings
Are you ones who fight but fail submit,
Applications with deadlines due.
They'd be on time if you are too.

The difference is an hour halved
From the Eastern cusp of desert sands
Geotemporal spacetime shifts
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.

We've got a half an hour come between
The sands and the silica-desert forest screens.
