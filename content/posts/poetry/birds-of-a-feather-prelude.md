The last we saw of her that night,  
Was the cawing and the laughs,  
Of a cigarette-wielding parrot,  
trying to get into her pants

She was a parrot of her love,  
She was the reflection found inside,  
She was the sad truth that,  
she held a mirrors without her doves.

She was echoes of of her tone,  
That reinforced what she thought,  
Further, and forevermore,  
A wooden house recast in stone.

And the concrete had to grow its wings,  
A tattered pair, but colourful,  
And light enough to catch and scoop  
the air found underneath.

She said that he was still:  
Bluebottle eggs, on a buzzing lake,  
But she kept talking talking talking  
Talking for her sake.

Coz she was a parrot of her love,  
And the dove was stuck inside,  
She told her that she loved her,  
But she was just looking for a light.
