There was something in her voice  
When it washed over me,  
My ears would stop,  
And filter out the noise.

It'd been a while since I'd been by,  
And I can't say that I'm happy,  
But I can say that I'm proud.

There was something in eyes  
When it locked with mine,  
That killed me slow,  
But it made me feel alive.

And I wanna live,  
don't just want to  
only survive.
